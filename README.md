# university-db

Homework project for Coders School. I have put every effort to meet the requirements and not go beyond. Therefor code
presented here is not a complete application by any means.

The code is covered by tests only partially as 100% coverage was not required.

Every requirement has been met including additional ones. Personal ID number (PESEL) checker is in PersonBuilder.cpp.
